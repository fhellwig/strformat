# strformat

Node.js string formatting the way you expect it to work.

## Installation

    npm install strformat

## API

    strformat(str, args...)

Replaces the placeholders in `str` with the substitution values in `args...`.
The `args...` parameter can be an object, an array, or a list of values.

If the second parameter is an object, then the placeholders are in the form of
`{<property>}` where the `<property>` is a property of the object.

If the second parameter is an array or a list of values, then the placeholders
are in the form of `{<n>}` where `<n>` is either the array index or the
positional index of the substitution value in the argument list.

Placeholders are escaped by doubling them (e.g., {{0}}). Any placeholder not
matching an argument is left alone.

Returns the formatted string.

## Examples

For all examples, the `strformat` function is exported by the `strformat` module:

```javascript
var strformat = require('strformat');
```

### Object property substitution

```javascript
var logfile = strformat('/var/log/{name}.log', require('./package.json'));
console.log(logfile);
```

>Output: `/var/log/strformat.log`

### Array index substitution

```javascript
var code = [404, 'Not Found'];
var status = strformat('status code {0} is "{1}"', code);
console.log(status);
```

>Output: `status code 404 is "Not Found"`

### Positional argument substitution

```javascript
var message = strformat('please press {0} for {1}', 'F1', 'help');
console.log(message);
```

>Output: `please press F1 for help`
